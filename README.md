# Restaurant-Market-Analysis
EDA for the global restaurant dataset
As your restaurant business expands, market analysis is critical to ensuring you select the best possible sites for your new locations and optimize your real estate portfolio. While it might be nice to imagine that you can simply find a good opportunity and seize it, this will rarely lead your business to the best opportunities, and it isn’t effective at scale.

Restaurant market analysis uses established criteria to evaluate, compare, and prioritize opportunities to open, close, or consolidate restaurant locations. With effective analysis, you can select the sites that best align with your location strategy and have the most significant impact on your bottom line. The challenge is knowing what to analyze and how to do it.

Keys to restaurant market analysis
There are so many different criteria you could use to analyze a potential market and evaluate the best opportunities that it’s easy to miss the most important factors. If you want to accurately compare your options, here’s what your analysis needs to involve.
1.  Find your customers (and more people like them)
2.  Score each site’s accessibility and visibility
3.  Analyze traffic patterns
4.  Map points of interest
5.  Assess overlap with competitors
6.  Forecast potential sales
7.  Build a prioritized list
